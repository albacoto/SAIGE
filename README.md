# SAIGE PROJECT OVERVIEW

The project revolves around neurodevelopmental diseases which are Autism, ADHD, Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder.
The disorders described are characterized by the involvement of both rare and common genetic variants that influence brain function and development. They have a polygenic nature meaning that each disorder is influenced by multiple genes, with no single gene being solely responsible. Instead, numerous genetic variants, often spread across many genes, contribute to the overall risk.

The SAIGE-GENE+ is a statistical tool designed to perform gene-based association tests, particularly in large-scale biobank data sets. 

Data for this porject is coming from dried blood samples and it is stored in a file called iPSYCH2016 which has been updated from iPSYCH2012 and iPSYCH2015.

PREPARATION FOR SAIGE
(The work will be done in a closed zone)
1.	Install conda in the closed zone
2.	Create an enviroment to conduct the SAIGE methodology
3.	Conda install SAIGE

https://anaconda.org/bioconda/r-saige

For the data it is also a must to have an enviroment with plink installed since we are going to need it to obtain some input for SAIGE.
